# Linda Loring Nature Foundation Phenology dataset
                                         
**Phenology Dataset has been given by Dr. Sarah T Bois. This data has been recorded as per month basis and then later divided as per Sites.
This dataset contains some important parameters for phenology like Date & Time, Temerature, Intensity and many more.**

### Below I have attached some Rplots which has been created with Date & Time, Temerature, Intensity variables.

#### 1a) Two scatter plots of two different variables

From this scatter plot we can make some comments like Intensity is increasing as the temperature increases. There are some data missing in the excel file for Intensity and Temperature for some dates.

```
> library(tidyverse)
> library(ggplot2)
> LLNF <- read.csv("Site_H.csv", header = TRUE)
> colnames(LLNF)
> names(LLNF)[names(LLNF) == "Date.Time..GMT.04.00"] <- "DateTime"
> names(LLNF)[names(LLNF) == "Temp..Â.C..LGR.S.N..10638853..SEN.S.N..10638853."] <- "Temperature"
> names(LLNF)[names(LLNF) == "Intensity..Lux..LGR.S.N..10638853..SEN.S.N..10638853."] <- "Intensity"
> ggplot(LLNF,aes(x=Temperature,y=Intensity))+
+ geom_point(color="Dark blue")
```

#### 1b)
From the Rplot we can say that Intensity is consistent for few months (June 2016-Oct 2016). There are some outliers, may be they are bad readings.

```
> LLNF$DateTime <- as.Date(LLNF$DateTime,format("%m/%d/%y"))
> ggplot(LLNF,aes(x=DateTime,y=Intensity))+
+ geom_point(color="Dark blue")
```
---
#### 2) One scatter plot with three variables

From the below Scatter plot we can suggest that through the DateTime , Intensity is consistent and Intensity has large value when temperature was above 20°C

```
> ggplot(LLNF,aes(x=DateTime,y=Intensity,color=Temperature))+
+ geom_point()
```
---
#### 3) One scatter plot of two variables, properly labeled, with a trend line added in

Trend line in below scatter plot is showing that intensity is proportional to Temperature. Trend line is going upwards as Intensity increases with Temperature.

**_Note_**: This plot can have negative values for Temperature but as excel sheet does not contain any negative values for Temperature so thus plot.

```
> ggplot(LLNF,aes(x=Temperature,y=Intensity))+
+ geom_point()+
+ geom_smooth(method="lm")
```

#### 4) One faceted plot of two variables

From the below plot we can observe two different varibales in two different windows, it easy to compare Intensity and Temperature variable as per the DateTime which is on X axis.

```
> LLNF1<-gather(LLNF,key="measure",value="value",c(Intensity,Temperature))
> ggplot(LLNF1,aes(x=DateTime,y=value))+
+ geom_point()+
+ facet_wrap(~measure)+
+ theme_bw()
```
---
#### 5) One bar chart

Temperature is consistent through the months (June 2016-Oct 2016), I am not sure about the values of Y axis as they are coming like 200, 400..

![](https://github.com/dhwani1403/LLNF_Data/blob/master/Rplot.jpeg)
```
> ggplot(LLNF,aes(x=DateTime,y=Temperature,fill="grp"))+
+ geom_bar(stat="identity",color="blue",width=0.5)
```
